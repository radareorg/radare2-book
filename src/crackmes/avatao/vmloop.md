![vmloop bb-0a45](img/vmloop/bb-0a45.png)

Well, that seems disappointingly short, but no worries, we have plenty to
reverse yet. The thing is that this function uses a jump table at 0x00400a74,

![vmloop bb-0a74](img/vmloop/bb-0a74.png)

and r2 can't yet recognize jump tables
([Issue 3201](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues/3201)), so the analysis of
this function is a bit incomplete. This means that we can't really use the graph
view now, so either we just use visual mode, or fix those basic blocks. The
entire function is just 542 bytes long, so we certainly could reverse it without
the aid of the graph mode, but since this writeup aims to include as much r2
wisdom as possible, I'm going to show you how to define basic blocks.

First, lets analyze what we already have! First, _rdi_ is put into local_3.
Since the application is a 64bit Linux executable, we know that _rdi_ is the
first function argument (as you may have recognized, the automatic analysis of
arguments and local variables was not entirely correct), and we also know that
_vmloop_'s first argument is the bytecode. So lets rename local_3:

```
:> afvn local_3 bytecode
```

Next, _sym.memory_ is put into another local variable at _rbp-8_ that r2 did not
recognize. So let's define it!

```
:> afv 8 memory qword
```

> _**r2 tip**_: The _afv [idx] [name] [type]_ command is used to define local
> variable at [frame pointer - idx] with the name [name] and type [type]. You
> can also remove local variables using the _afv- [idx]_ command.

In the next block, the program checks one byte of bytecode, and if it is 0, the
function returns with 1.

![vmloop bb-0c4d](img/vmloop/bb-0c4d.png)

If that byte is not zero, the program subtracts 0x41 from it, and compares the
result to 0x17. If it is above 0x17, we get the dreaded "Wrong!" message, and
the function returns with 0. This basically means that valid bytecodes are ASCII
characters in the range of "A" (0x41) through "X" (0x41 + 0x17). If the bytecode
is valid, we arrive at the code piece that uses the jump table:

![vmloop bb-0a74](img/vmloop/bb-0a74.png)

The jump table's base is at 0x400ec0, so lets define that memory area as a
series of qwords:

```
[0x00400a74]> s 0x00400ec0
[0x00400ec0]> Cd 8 @@=`?s $$ $$+8*0x17 8`
```

> _**r2 tip**_: Except for the _?s_, all parts of this command should be

> series generated using the _?s_ command. _?s_ simply generates a series from
> the current seek (*$$*) to current seek + 8*0x17 (*$$+8*0x17*) with a step
> of 8.

This is how the disassembly looks like after we add this metadata:

```
[0x00400ec0]> pd 0x18
            ; DATA XREF from 0x00400a76 (unk)

            0x00400f40 .qword 0x0000000000400c04
            0x00400f48 .qword 0x0000000000400be5
            0x00400f50 .qword 0x0000000000400ab6
            0x00400f58 .qword 0x0000000000400c04
            0x00400f60 .qword 0x0000000000400c04

            0x00400f70 .qword 0x0000000000400c04
            0x00400f78 .qword 0x0000000000400b99
```

As we can see, the address 0x400c04 is used a lot, and besides that there are 9
different addresses. Lets see that 0x400c04 first!

![vmloop bb-0c04](img/vmloop/bb-0c04.png)

We get the message "Wrong!", and the function just returns 0. This means that
those are not valid instructions (they are valid bytecode though, they can be
e.g. parameters!) We should flag 0x400c04 accordingly:

```
[0x00400ec0]> f not_instr @ 0x0000000000400c04
```

As for the other offsets, they all seem to be doing something meaningful, so we
can assume they belong to valid instructions. I'm going to flag them using the
instructions' ASCII values:

```
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_A @ 0x0000000000400a80
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_C @ 0x0000000000400b6d
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_D @ 0x0000000000400b17
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_I @ 0x0000000000400aec
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_J @ 0x0000000000400bc1
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_P @ 0x0000000000400b42
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_R @ 0x0000000000400be5
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_S @ 0x0000000000400ab6
[0x00400ec0]> f instr_X @ 0x0000000000400b99
```

Ok, so these offsets were not on the graph, so it is time to define basic blocks
for them!

We can get the start and end addresses of these basic blocks from the full disasm
of _vmloop_.

![vmloop full](img/vmloop/vmloop-full.png)

As I've mentioned previously, the function itself is pretty short, and easy to
read, especially with our annotations. But a promise is a promise, so here is
how we can create the missing basic blocks for the instructions:

```
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400a80 0x00400ab6-0x00400a80 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400ab6 0x00400aec-0x00400ab6 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400aec 0x00400b17-0x00400aec 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b17 0x00400b42-0x00400b17 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b42 0x00400b6d-0x00400b42 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b6d 0x00400b99-0x00400b6d 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b99 0x00400bc1-0x00400b99 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400bc1 0x00400be5-0x00400bc1 0x400c15
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400be5 0x00400c04-0x00400be5 0x400c15
```

It is also apparent from the disassembly that besides the instructions there
are three more basic blocks. Lets create them too!

```
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400c15 0x00400c2d-0x00400c15 0x400c3c 0x00400c2d
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400c2d 0x00400c3c-0x00400c2d 0x400c4d 0x00400c3c
[0x00400ec0]> afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400c3c 0x00400c4d-0x00400c3c 0x400c61
```

Note that the basic blocks starting at 0x00400c15 and 0x00400c2d ending in a
conditional jump, so we had to set the false branch's destination too!

And here is the graph in its full glory after a bit of manual restructuring:

![vmloop graph](img/vmloop/vmloop-graph-reconstructed_full.png)

I think it worth it, don't you? :) (Well, the restructuring did not really worth
it, because it is apparently not stored when you save the project.)

> _**r2 tip**_: You can move the selected node around in graph view using the
> HJKL keys.

By the way, here is how IDA's graph of this same function looks like for comparison:

![IDA graph](img/vmloop_ida.png)

As we browse through the disassembly of the _instr_LETTER_ basic blocks, we
should realize a few things. The first: all of the instructions starts with a
sequence like these:

![vmloop bb-0a80](img/vmloop/bb-0a80.png)

![vmloop bb-0ab6](img/vmloop/bb-0ab6.png)

It became clear now that the 9 dwords at _sym.instr_dirty_ are not simply
indicators that an instruction got executed, but they are used to count how many
times an instruction got called. Also I should have realized earlier that
_sym.good_if_le_9_ (0x6020f0) is part of this 9 dword array, but yeah, well, I
didn't, I have to live with it... Anyways, what the condition
"_sym.good_if_le_9_ have to be lesser or equal 9" really means is that _instr_P_
can not be executed more than 9 times:

![vmloop bb-0b42](img/vmloop/bb-0b42.png)

Another similarity of the instructions is that 7 of them calls a function with
either one or two parameters, where the parameters are the next, or the next two
bytecodes. One parameter example:

![vmloop bb-0aec](img/vmloop/bb-0aec.png)

And a two parameters example:

![vmloop bb-0a80_full](img/vmloop/bb-0a80_full.png)

We should also realize that these blocks put the number of bytes they eat up of
the bytecode (1 byte instruction + 1 or 2 bytes arguments = 2 or 3) into a local
variable at 0xc. r2 did not recognize this local var, so lets do it manually!

```
:> afv 0xc instr_ptr_step dword
```

If we look at _instr_J_ we can see that this is an exception to the above rule,
since it puts the return value of the called function into _instr_ptr_step_
instead of a constant 2 or 3:

![vmloop bb-0bc1](img/vmloop/bb-0bc1.png)

And speaking of exceptions, here are the two instructions that do not call functions:

![vmloop bb-0be5](img/vmloop/bb-0be5.png)

This one simply puts the next bytecode (the first the argument) into _eax_, and
jumps to the end of _vmloop_. So this is the VM's _ret_ instruction, and we know
that _vmloop_ has to return "\*", so "R\*" should be the last two bytes of our
bytecode.

The next one that does not call a function:

![vmloop bb-0b6d](img/vmloop/bb-0b6d.png)

This is a one argument instruction, and it puts its argument to 0x6020c0. Flag
that address!

```
:> f sym.written_by_instr_C 4 @ 0x6020c0
```

Oh, and by the way, I do have a hunch that _instr_C_ also had a function call in
the original code, but it got inlined by the compiler. Anyways, so far we have
these two instructions:

* _instr_R(a1):_ returns with _a1_
* _instr_C(a1):_ writes _a1_ to _sym.written_by_instr_C_

And we also know that these accept one argument,

* instr_I
* instr_D
* instr_P
* instr_X
* instr_J

and these accept two:

* instr_A
* instr_S

What remains is the reversing of the seven functions that are called by the
instructions, and finally the construction of a valid bytecode that gives us the
flag.

### instr_A

The function this instruction calls is at offset 0x40080d, so lets seek there!

```
[offset]> 0x40080d
```

> _**r2 tip:**_ In visual mode you can just hit \<Enter\> when the current line is
> a jump or a call, and r2 will seek to the destination address.

If we seek to that address from the graph mode, we are presented with a message
that says "Not in a function. Type 'df' to define it here. This is because the
function is called from a basic block r2 did not recognize, so r2 could not
find the function either. Lets obey, and type _df_! A function is indeed created, but
we want some meaningful name for it. So press _dr_ while still in visual mode,
and name this function _instr_A_!

![instr_A minimap](img/instr_A/instr_A_minimap.png)

> _**r2 tip:**_ You should realize that these commands are all part of the same
> menu system in visual mode I was talking about when we first used _Cd_ to
> declare _sym.memory_ as data.

Ok, now we have our shiny new _fcn.instr_A_, lets reverse it! We can see from
the shape of the minimap that probably there is some kind cascading
if-then-elif, or a switch-case statement involved in this function. This is one
of the reasons the minimap is so useful: you can recognize some patterns at a
glance, which can help you in your analysis (remember the easily recognizable
for loop from a few paragraphs before?) So, the minimap is cool and useful, but
I've just realized that I did not yet show you the full graph mode, so I'm
going to do this using full graph. The first basic blocks:

![instr_A bb-080d](img/instr_A/bb-080d.png)

The two function arguments (_rdi_ and _rsi_) are stored in local variables, and
the first is compared to 0. If it is, the function returns (you can see it on
the minimap), otherwise the same check is executed on the second argument. The
function returns from here too, if the argument is zero. Although this function
is really tiny, I am going to stick with my methodology, and rename the local
vars:

```
:> afvn local_1 arg1
:> afvn local_2 arg2
```

And we have arrived to the predicted switch-case statement, and we can see that
_arg1_'s value is checked against "M", "P", and "C".

![instr_A switch values](img/instr_A/switch-values.png)

This is the "M" branch:

![instr_A switch-M](img/instr_A/switch-M.png)

It basically loads an address from offset 0x602088 and adds _arg2_ to the byte
at that address. As r2 kindly shows us in a comment, 0x602088 initially holds
the address of _sym.memory_, the area where we have to construct the "Such VM!
MuCH reV3rse!" string. It is safe to assume that somehow we will be able to
modify the value stored at 0x602088, so this "M" branch will be able to modify
bytes other than the first. Based on this assumption, I'll flag 0x602088 as
_sym.current_memory_ptr_:

```
:> f sym.current_memory_ptr 8 @ 0x602088
```

Moving on to the "P" branch:

![instr_A switch-P](img/instr_A/switch-P.png)

Yes, this is the piece of code that allows us to modify
_sym.current_memory_ptr_: it adds _arg2_ to it.

Finally, the "C" branch:

![instr_A switch-C](img/instr_A/switch-C.png)

Well, it turned out that _instr_C_ is not the only instruction that modifies
_sym.written_by_instr_C_: this piece of code adds _arg2_ to it.

And that was _instr_A_, lets summarize it! Depending on the first argument, this
instruction does the following:

* _arg1_ == "M": adds _arg2_ to the byte at _sym.current_memory_ptr_.
* _arg1_ == "P": steps _sym.current_memory_ptr_ by _arg2_ bytes.
* _arg1_ == "C": adds _arg2_ to the value at _sym.written_by_instr_C_.

### instr_S

This function is not recognized either, so we have to manually define it like we
did with _instr_A_. After we do, and take a look at the minimap, scroll through
the basic blocks, it is pretty obvious that these two functions are very-very
similar. We can use _radiff2_ to see the difference.

> _**r2 tip:**_ radiff2 is used to compare binary files. There's a few options

> option.

Since now we want to diff two functions from the same binary, we specify the
offsets with _-g_, and use reverse4 for both binaries. Also, we create the
graphs for comparing _instr_A_ to _instr_S_ and for comparing _instr_S_ to
_instr_A_.

```
[0x00 ~]$ radiff2 -g 0x40080d,0x40089f  reverse4 reverse4 | xdot -
```

![instr_S graph1](img/instr_S/graph1.png)

```
[0x00 ~]$ radiff2 -g 0x40089f,0x40080d  reverse4 reverse4 | xdot -
```

![instr_S graph2](img/instr_S/graph2.png)

A sad truth reveals itself after a quick glance at these graphs: radiff2 is a
liar! In theory, grey boxes should be identical, yellow ones should differ only
at some offsets, and red ones should differ seriously. Well this is obviously
not the case here - e.g. the larger grey boxes are clearly not identical. This
is something I'm definitely going to take a deeper look at after I've finished
this writeup.

Anyways, after we get over the shock of being lied to, we can easily recognize
that _instr_S_ is basically a reverse-_instr_A_: where the latter does addition,
the former does subtraction. To summarize this:

* _arg1_ == "M": subtracts _arg2_ from the byte at _sym.current_memory_ptr_.
* _arg1_ == "P": steps _sym.current_memory_ptr_ backwards by _arg2_ bytes.
* _arg1_ == "C": subtracts _arg2_ from the value at _sym.written_by_instr_C_.

### instr_I

![instr_I](img/instr_I/instr_I.png)

This one is simple, it just calls _instr_A(arg1, 1)_. As you may have noticed
the function call looks like `call fcn.0040080d` instead of `call fcn.instr_A`.
This is because when you save and open a project, function names get lost -
another thing to examine and patch in r2!

### instr_D

![instr_D](img/instr_D/instr_D.png)

Again, simple: it calls _instr_S(arg1, 1)_.

### instr_P

It's local var rename time again!

```
:> afvn local_0_1 const_M
:> afvn local_0_2 const_P
:> afvn local_3 arg1
```

![instr_P](img/instr_P/instr_P.png)

This function is pretty straightforward also, but there is one oddity: const_M
is never used. I don't know why it is there - maybe it is supposed to be some
kind of distraction? Anyways, this function simply writes _arg1_ to
_sym.current_memory_ptr_, and than calls _instr_I("P")_. This basically means
that _instr_P_ is used to write one byte, and put the pointer to the next byte.
So far this would seem the ideal instruction to construct most of the "Such VM!
MuCH reV3rse!" string, but remember, this is also the one that can be used only
9 times!

### instr_X

Another simple one, rename local vars anyways!

```
:> afvn local_1 arg1
```

![instr_X](img/instr_X/instr_X.png)

This function XORs the value at _sym.current_memory_ptr_ with _arg1_.

### instr_J

This one is not as simple as the previous ones, but it's not that complicated
either. Since I'm obviously obsessed with variable renaming:

```
:> afvn local_3 arg1
:> afvn local_0_4 arg1_and_0x3f
```

![instr_J](img/instr_J/instr_J.png)

After the result of _arg1 & 0x3f_ is put into a local variable, _arg1 & 0x40_ is
checked against 0. If it isn't zero, _arg1_and_0x3f_ is negated:

![instr_J bb-09e1](img/instr_J/bb-09e1.png)

The next branching: if _arg1_ >= 0, then the function returns _arg1_and_0x3f_,

![instr_J bb-09e4](img/instr_J/bb-09e4.png)

![instr_J bb-0a1a](img/instr_J/bb-0a1a.png)

else the function branches again, based on the value of
_sym.written_by_instr_C_:

![instr_J bb-09ef](img/instr_J/bb-09ef.png)

If it is zero, the function returns 2,

![instr_J bb-0a13](img/instr_J/bb-0a13.png)

else it is checked if _arg1_and_0x3f_ is a negative number,

![instr_J bb-09f9](img/instr_J/bb-09f9.png)

and if it is, _sym.good_if_ne_zero_ is incremented by 1:

![instr_J bb-09ff](img/instr_J/bb-09ff.png)

After all this, the function returns with _arg1_and_0x3f_:

![instr_J bb-0a0e](img/instr_J/bb-0a0e.png)
