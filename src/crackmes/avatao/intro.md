## Avatao R3v3rs3 4

After a few years of missing out on wargames at
[Hacktivity](https://hacktivity.com), this year I've finally found the time to
begin, and almost finish (yeah, I'm quite embarrassed about that unfinished
webhack :) ) one of them. There were 3 different games at the conf, and I've
chosen the one that was provided by [avatao](https://avatao.com). It consisted
of 8 challenges, most of them being basic web hacking stuff, one sandbox escape,
one simple buffer overflow exploitation, and there were two reverse engineering
exercises too. You can find these challenges on <https://platform.avatao.com>.
