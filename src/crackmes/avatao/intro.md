## Avatao R3v3rs3 4

After a few years of missing out on wargames at
[Hacktivity](https://hacktivity.com), this year I've finally found the time to
begin, and almost finish (yeah, I'm quite embarrassed about that unfinished
webhack :) ) one of them. There were 3 different games at the conf, and I've
chosen the one that was provided by [avatao](https://avatao.com). It consisted
of 8 challenges, most of them being basic web hacking stuff, one sandbox escape,
one simple buffer overflow exploitation, and there were two reverse engineering
exercises too. You can find these challenges on https://platform.avatao.com.
