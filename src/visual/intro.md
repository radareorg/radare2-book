# Visual Mode

The visual mode is a more user-friendly interface alternative to radare2's command-line prompt. It allows easy navigation, has a cursor mode for selecting bytes, and offers numerous key bindings to simplify debugger use.
To enter visual mode, use `V` command. To exit from it back to command line, press `q`.

## Navigation

Navigation can be done using HJKL or arrow keys and PgUp/PgDown keys. It also understands usual Home/End keys.
Like in Vim the movements can be repeated by preceding the navigation key with the number, for
example `5j` will move down for 5 lines, or `2l` will move 2 characters right.

## Print Modes, a.k.a. Panels

The Visual mode uses "print modes" which are basically different panels that you can rotate. By default those are:

**Hexdump panel** -> **Disassembly panel** -> **Debugger panel** -> **Hexadecimal words dump panel** -> **Hex-less hexdump panel** -> **Op analysis color map panel** -> **Annotated hexdump panel** -> **Hexdump panel** -> **[...]**

Notice that the top of the panel contains the command which is used, for example for the disassembly panel:

```
[0x00404890 16% 120 /bin/ls]> pd $r @ entry0
```
