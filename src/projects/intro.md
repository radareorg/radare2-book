# Introduction to Projects

When working on a binary analysis, there are scenarios where you need to continuously work on a single or a set of binaries over a long period of time. This could be due to the complexity of the binaries or the amount of time required for in-depth analysis.

In such cases, you often want to store and keep track of your progress, such as comments, function names, and other metadata, so you donâ€™t have to redo or reanalyze the same information every time you reload the binary.

This chapter will explore how to handle these needs efficiently by introducing Radare2 projects. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations inherent in this process. Although managing projects may seem straightforward, it is one of the more difficult issues to address, and it's essential to understand why before delving into solutions.
