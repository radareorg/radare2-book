# Project Versioning

Radare2 have its own versioning control system. It's like a simple `git`. But also acts as a way to wrap the use of **git** under the same API.

Using the `ravc2` command or its `rvc` counterpart API you can see the project history, revert to previous versions, clone a repository, etc

The benefit of using a version control system for projects is clear when you work with more people, and this is useful too because r2 projects are basically r2 scripts that are easy to read, compare and review.
