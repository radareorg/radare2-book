# Tools

Radare2 is not just the only tool provided by the radare2 project. The rest if chapters in this book are focused on explaining the use of the radare2 tool, this chapter will focus on explaining all the other companion tools that are shipped inside the radare2 project.

All the functionalities provided by the different APIs and plugins have also different tools to allow to use them from the commandline and integrate them with shellscripts easily.

Thanks to the ortogonal design of the framework it is possible to do all the things that r2 is able from different places:

* these companion tools
* native library apis
* scripting with r2pipe
* the r2 shell
