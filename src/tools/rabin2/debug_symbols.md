### Debug Symbols

Radare2 automatically parses available imports and exports sections in the binary,
moreover, it can load additional debugging information if present.
Two main formats are supported: DWARF and PDB (for Windows binaries).
Note that, unlike many tools radare2 doesn't rely on Windows API to parse
PDB files, thus they can be loaded on any other supported platform - e.g.
Linux or OS X.

DWARF debug info loads automatically by default because usually it's stored
right in the executable file. PDB is a bit of a different beast - it is always
stored as a separate binary, thus the different logic of handling it.

At first, one of the common scenarios is to analyze the file from Windows distribution.
In this case, all PDB files are available on the Microsoft server, which is by default
is in options. See all pdb options in radare2:

```
pdb.autoload = 0
pdb.extract = 1
pdb.server = https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
pdb.useragent = Microsoft-Symbol-Server/6.11.0001.402
```

Using the variable `pdb.server` you can change the address where radare2 will try to
download the PDB file by the GUID stored in the executable header.
You can make use of multiple symbol servers by separating each URL with a space:

```
e pdb.server = https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols https://symbols.mozilla.org
```

On Windows,  you can also use local network share paths (UNC paths) as symbol servers.

Usually, there is no reason to change default `pdb.useragent`, but who knows where
could it be handy?

Because those PDB files are stored as "cab" archives on the server, `pdb.extract=1`
says to automatically extract them.

Note that for the automatic downloading to work you need "cabextract" tool, and wget/curl installed.

Sometimes you don't need to do that from the radare2 itself, thus - two handy
rabin2 options:

```
 -P              show debug/pdb information
 -PP             download pdb file for binary
```

where `-PP` automatically downloads the pdb for the selected binary, using those
`pdb.*` config options. `-P` will dump the contents of the PDB file, which is useful
sometimes for a quick understanding of the symbols stored in it.

Apart from the basic scenario of just opening a file, PDB information can be additionally
manipulated by the `id` commands:

```
[0x000051c0]> id?
|Usage: id Debug information
| Output mode:
| '*'              Output in radare commands
| id               Source lines
| idp [file.pdb]   Load pdb file information
| idpi [file.pdb]  Show pdb file information
| idpd             Download pdb file on remote server
```

Where `idpi` is basically the same as `rabin2 -P`.
Note that `idp` can be also used not only in the static analysis mode, but also
in the debugging mode, even if connected via WinDbg.

For simplifying the loading PDBs, especially for the processes with many linked DLLs,
radare2 can autoload all required PDBs automatically - you need just set the
`e pdb.autoload=true` option. Then if you load some file in debugging mode
in Windows, using `r2 -d file.exe` or `r2 -d 2345` (attach to pid 2345), all
related PDB files will be loaded automatically.

DWARF information loading, on the other hand, is completely automated. You don't
need to run any commands/change any options:

```

As you can see, it loads function names and source line information.
