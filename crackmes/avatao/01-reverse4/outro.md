Well, what can I say? Such VM, much reverse! :)

What started out as a simple writeup for a simple crackme, became a rather
lengthy writeup/r2 tutorial, so kudos if you've read through it. I hope you
enjoyed it (I know I did), and maybe even learnt something from it. I've surely
learnt a lot about r2 during the process, and I've even contributed some small
patches, and got a few ideas of more possible improvements.
