## Disassembler Configuration

The assembler and disassembler have many small switches to tweak the output.

Those configurations are available through the `e` command. Here there are the most common ones:

* asm.bytes - show/hide bytes
* asm.offset - show/hide offset
* asm.lines - show/hide lines
* asm.ucase - show disasm in uppercase
* ...

Use the `e??asm.` for more details.
